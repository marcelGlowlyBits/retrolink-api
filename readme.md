# Retrolink-api

## Description
This is the repository for the backend api for Retrolink. Retrolink is a new customer-to-customer marketplace for secondhand gaming items.
A seperate rest api will be build for this platform. First of all, so that we can keep the frontend framework agnostic. Secondly, we can scale the backend seperatly.

## prerequisites
- Docker
- Node
- Make

## Getting started
The whole application is dockerized. Even in development. So to start developing is really simple, just run. 

```
make run-dev
```

## Docs
This project has a docs folder. This is my first production experience being a backend developer. So it would be wise to document alot, for future reference.
